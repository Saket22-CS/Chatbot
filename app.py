        This project consists of two main components:
        1. NLP and Machine Learning:
            - We used NLP techniques and the Logistic Regression algorithm to train the chatbot on labeled intents and entities.
            - The model processes user input, predicts the intent, and generates relevant responses.      
        2. Interactive Interface with Streamlit:
            - A web-based interface was developed using Streamlit to allow users to interact with the chatbot seamlessly.
            - The interface includes a text input field for queries and a display area for responses, ensuring an engaging user experience.

        The dataset used in this project is a collection of labelled intents and entities. The data is stored in a list.
        - Intents: Categories representing the purpose of user inputs (e.g., greeting, budget, about).
        - Entities: Extracted information or key phrases from the user input (e.g., "Hi", "How do I create a budget?", "What is your purpose?").
        - Text: User input phrases used to train and test the model.

        The chatbot interface is designed for simplicity and interactivity.
        - User Input Field: Users can type their queries into a text box.
        - Chat Display: Responses generated by the trained model are displayed in a chat-like format.
        - Real-Time Interaction: The chatbot leverages the trained model to provide quick and meaningful replies, ensuring a smooth conversational flow.

        To enhance this project, we plan to:  
        1. Expand the dataset with more intents and diverse user queries.
        2. Integrate advanced NLP models like transformers (e.g., BERT, GPT) for better intent detection.
        3. Incorporate features like speech-to-text and text-to-speech for multimodal interactions.
