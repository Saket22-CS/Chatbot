## **Overview**
Welcome to **AlphaAI**, a conversational chatbot designed using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** techniques. AlphaAI understands user inputs, predicts their intent, and provides dynamic responses through an elegant **Streamlit** web interface. It also logs conversations for future reference, offering a seamless and interactive experience.

## **Features**

### üß† **Core Functionalities**
- **Intent Recognition:** Uses **TF-IDF Vectorizer** and **Logistic Regression** for intent prediction.
- **Dynamic Responses:** Responds with predefined phrases based on the detected intent.
- **Conversation Logging:** Logs all interactions (user queries, chatbot responses, timestamps) to a `chat_log.csv` file for transparency and analysis.

### üåê **Streamlit-Based Interface**
- **User-Friendly Chatbox:** A clean and interactive interface for seamless conversations.
- **Sidebar Menu:**  
  - **Home:** Chat with AlphaAI.  
  - **Conversation History:** View a detailed log of past interactions.  
  - **About:** Learn more about the project, its architecture, and future scope.

### üìä **Conversation History**
View a chronological log of all chats, including:
- User queries.
- Chatbot responses.
- Timestamps for every interaction.
